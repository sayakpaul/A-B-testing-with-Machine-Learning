        "The field of self-supervised visual representation learning is progressing pretty fast. With recent advancements, the deep learning community has started to consider it as an alternative to the fully supervised models for tasks like image classification, object detection, image segmentation, etc. If you are unfamiliar with self-supervised learning check out [this blog post](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/13/self_supervised/) by Jeremy Howard. So, ***why all the fuss around self-supervised visual representation learning?***\n",
        "\n",
        "This is because a self-supervised learning framework can benefit from ***unlabeled data***. Essentially, you would frame a supervised learning task from a large unlabeled corpus and then train a model to learn that task. You see we are ***not*** using any explicit label information here. Instead, we are using the given data to form a supervised learning task, this is why it is self-supervised. You would then take the representations from the model (preferably from the encoder part of the model) and use them for downstream tasks. Representations learned using self-supervised learning frameworks like SimCLRv2, SwAV [5] transfer quite well to downstream (vision) tasks even with very less labeled data.\n",

        "Among all of the techniques that have been mentioned in the post so far, SimCLR is by far the most favorite of mine.  This is because of its simplicity and the promise to shine more as one would scale up the base architecture and introduce more (unlabeled data). Moreover, framework wise SimCLR is very consistent with the recipes I would want to see in an effective visual representation learning framework. One of these primary recipes is to maximize the agreement between the semantically similar images. SwAV is also capable of doing this, in fact, it is currently the state-of-the-art (as of August 2020) in this domain. But simplicity wise SimCLR beats SwAV big time.\n",

        "At a very high-level, SimCLR takes two different views of the same image and tries to maximize the agreement between these two views while minimizing the agreement between the views coming from other images.
